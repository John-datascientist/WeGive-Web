  },
  {
    q: "How is the delivery fee actually calculated?",
    a: "A base fee plus a per-kilometre rate, adjusted for vehicle type, then VAT and a small WeeGive admin fee. It's computed server-side from the real distance between giver and recipient, never estimated by the browser.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does a rider actually get paid?",
    a: "Only after delivery is confirmed complete. Until then, whatever was paid (by the recipient, the giver, or sponsors) sits in WeeGive's escrow wallet.",
