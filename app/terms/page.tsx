              You must be at least 18 to create a WeeGive account, and the
              details you provide (name, contact info, home postcode) must
              be accurate. Businesses go through a separate verification
              flow before they can list bulk giveaways or fund a corporate

                Every giveaway moves through the same lifecycle: DRAFT →
                PENDING_REVIEW → APPROVED → AVAILABLE → RESERVED → CLAIMED →
                DELIVERY_PENDING → DELIVERED → COMPLETED. Listings go through
                review before they&apos;re publicly visible.
              </p>
              <p>
                You&apos;re responsible for describing the item&apos;s
                condition accurately. At listing time, you choose whether
                you&apos;ll cover the delivery fee for whoever claims it;
                that commitment isn&apos;t charged until a claim exists and
                the fee is calculated.

              Claiming reserves an item for a limited time (30 minutes by
              default) while delivery is arranged. If a delivery isn&apos;t
              requested and funded before the reservation expires, the item
              returns to Available for someone else to claim. Some giveaways
              require a verified recipient before they can be claimed.

                Delivery fees are calculated server-side from distance, plus
                VAT and a WeeGive administration fee, never estimated or
                trusted from the browser. Whatever you pay, whether by card
                or bank transfer, is held in WeeGive&apos;s escrow wallet and
                released to the rider only once delivery is confirmed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyone can sponsor part or all of a delivery&apos;s fee
                through a shared link. Sponsorship contributions are also
                held in escrow and are non-refundable once a delivery is
                confirmed complete, except where WeeGive determines a refund
                is warranted.

              Deliveries are carried out by verified riders assigned through
              Loca8tor. Exact pickup and delivery addresses are shared with
              the relevant parties only once a delivery is confirmed. Rider
              and recipient can message each other only while a delivery is
              active.
