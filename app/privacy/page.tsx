                number, and your home postcode (entered manually or resolved

                and payment method (card or bank transfer). We don&apos;t

                Distance, routing, live tracking and postcode resolution are
                provided by Loca8tor, a sibling product under Workerholics
                Solutions, through its API. WeeGive never touches Loca8tor&apos;s
                underlying location database directly.

                other party solely once a claim is confirmed and a delivery
                is being arranged.

              immediately. We record who paid, how (card or bank transfer),
              how much, and when it&apos;s released to a rider or refunded.
              This transaction history is visible to WeeGive admins for
              dispute resolution, never sold or shared for marketing.
